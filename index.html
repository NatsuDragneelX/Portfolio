            <h3>Elemental Puzzle Game</h3>
            <p>Technologies: C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Custom Puzzle Engine, Leaderboards, Achievements</p>
            <p>Developed a puzzle-based game using C++ as part of a class project in a group of 5 to 6 people, which challenges players to master four elemental forces: Air, Water, Fire, and Earth. The game includes the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-Stage Puzzles: Players solve unique puzzles based on each element, with varying levels of difficulty and stages.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Question Selection: Implemented a system to dynamically select random questions for each element, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended questions.</li>
                <li>Scoring & Achievements: Players earn points for correct answers, unlock achievements, and can track their progress via a leaderboard.</li>
                <li>Modular Design: Structured code using separate modules for puzzles, player progress, and game logic, ensuring maintainability and scalability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project showcases my skills in C++ development, problem-solving, and game logic design.</p>

            <h3>Custom PC Builder Web Application</h3>
            <p>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Backend, Database Integration</p>
            <p>Developed a full-stack web application as part of a class project in a group of 5 to 6 people, allowing users to build custom PCs by selecting components such as CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, memory, and more. The website also includes guides and product listings, offering a comprehensive experience for users looking to assemble their own PCs. Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Component Selection: Integrated a dynamic component selector where users can choose from a wide variety of PC parts, with real-time pricing and specifications. Compatibility checks between components ensure a smooth user experience.</li>
                <li>User Authentication: Implemented user registration and login functionality, allowing users to save their builds and access them later.</li>
                <li>Data Management: The application supports database-driven parts management, allowing users to view detailed information about each component and save their custom builds.</li>
                <li>Guides and Assistance: Provided step-by-step guides for assembling a PC, along with detailed parts lists, to assist novice builders.</li>
                <li>Mobile-Responsive Design: Ensured a fully responsive layout using Bootstrap, offering an optimized experience across devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project highlights my ability to build a complex, database-backed web application with a focus on user interaction, dynamic content, and component management.</p>

            <h3>Neuron Simulation Tool</h3>
            <p>Technologies: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Computational Neuroscience</p>
            <p>As part of a class project in a group of 5 to 6 people, I developed a neuron simulation tool that models and visualizes the membrane potential of neurons over time in response to different types of inputs. The tool includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulation Modes: Supports two modes: Current Mode and Spike Mode, simulating neuron behavior in response to different stimuli.</li>
                <li>Membrane Dynamics: Uses Euler's method to solve differential equations for neuron membrane potential, with adjustable parameters.</li>
                <li>Configuration File: Loads neuron model parameters from a customizable JSON configuration file.</li>
                <li>Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to plot the evolution of membrane potential over time.</li>
                <li>Command-Line Interface: Enables users to configure the simulation duration and other parameters via command-line arguments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project demonstrates my proficiency in mathematical modeling, scientific programming, and data visualization.</p>
