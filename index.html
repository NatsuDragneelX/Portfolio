            <h3>Neuron Simulation Tool</h3>
            <p>Technologies: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Computational Neuroscience</p>
            <p>As part of a class project in a group of 5 to 6 people, I developed a neuron simulation tool that models and visualizes the membrane potential of neurons over time in response to different types of inputs. The tool includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulation Modes: Supports two modes: Current Mode and Spike Mode, simulating neuron behavior in response to different stimuli.</li>
                <li>Membrane Dynamics: Uses Euler's method to solve differential equations for neuron membrane potential, with adjustable parameters.</li>
                <li>Configuration File: Loads neuron model parameters from a customizable JSON configuration file.</li>
                <li>Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to plot the evolution of membrane potential over time.</li>
                <li>Command-Line Interface: Enables users to configure the simulation duration and other parameters via command-line arguments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project demonstrates my proficiency in mathematical modeling, scientific programming, and data visualization.</p>

            <h3>Memory Matching Game</h3>
            <p>A memory card matching game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to match pairs of cards as quickly as possible. Each round, the cards are shuffled randomly, and players must remember the positions of the cards to find all matches. This project highlights skills in DOM manipulation and event handling.</p>

            <h3>Whack-a-Mole Game</h3>
            <p>An engaging and fast-paced JavaScript game where users test their reflexes by hitting moles that randomly appear on a grid. The game features multiple modes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classic Mode</strong>: Players have 30 seconds to hit as many moles as possible. The game gets progressively harder as moles appear faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultimate Mode</strong>: A shorter, more intense game where multiple moles pop up at once and players race against a tighter time limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Timer Mode</strong>: Players have 60 seconds to rack up the highest score possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game also includes a <strong>Combo System</strong> that rewards players with a score multiplier for consecutive hits without missing. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript timing functions, random element generation, dynamic event listeners, and responsive design techniques.</p>

            <h3>Simple Clicker Game</h3>
            <p>A JavaScript-based clicker game that progressively increases in difficulty. The goal is to click the button as many times as possible within a limited time. As the player advances through levels, the button starts moving to random positions on the screen, adding a challenge. After every 5 rounds, the game tracks and displays performance metrics, including the number of clicks per round and the average clicks. The game also includes a restart option, allowing players to start fresh at any time. This project demonstrates event handling, timers, state management, and dynamic UI updates in JavaScript.</p>
